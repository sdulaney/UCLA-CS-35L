Usage: 
shuf.py [OPTION]... [FILE]
shuf.py -i LO-HI [OPTION]...

Generate random permutations/shuffle lines of text.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_RANGE, --input-range=INPUT_RANGE
                        Act as if input came from a file containing the range
                        of unsigned decimal integers LO...HI, one per line.
  -n HEAD_COUNT, --head-count=HEAD_COUNT
                        Output at most COUNT lines. By default, all input
                        lines are output.
  -r, --repeat          Repeat output values, that is, select with
                        replacement. With this option the output is not a
                        permutation of the input; instead, each output line is
                        randomly chosen from all the inputs. This option is
                        typically combined with --head-count; if --head-count
                        is not given, shuf.py repeats indefinitely.
