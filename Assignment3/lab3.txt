Commands used for Lab:
NOTE: Trivial commands are not explained.

man ls

man exec

emacs la

chmod +x la

touch .foo

touch bar

./la -A
# This did not reproduce the problem.

which ls
# This revealed the default version of ls to be /usr/local/cs/bin/ls, so I
# updated the shell script la to use /usr/bin/ls.

./la -A
# This reproduced the problem now.

/usr/bin/ls --version
# This shows the Coreutils version "ls (GNU coreutils) 8.22".

# First, there is a warning and messages related to this being the first time
I've run gpg. Next gpg responds that the signature is good, meaning that the
signature was indeed created with the private key corresponding to
gnu-keyring.gpg and the file has not been modified since then. But there is
another warning "the key is not certified with a trusted signature and there is
no indication that the signature belongs to the owner". This is because the key
has not been marked as trusted by myself or someone within my web of trust
(Source: GPG Manual).

# Extract the file.

# Run configure script that checks system-dependent variables and creates
# Makefiles.

# /u/cs/ugrad/stewart/Assignment3/temp/bin.
make install

3.
# Reproduce the bug with the unmodified version of coreutils.
# Use a modified version of the shell script test that comes with the patch.
emacs test-a-option.sh
chmod +x test-a-option.sh
./test-a-option.sh

# Note this outputs 1, because the test fails. The command incorrectly outputs 
# "." and ".." as expected.

shell script test-a-option.sh:

4.
# Create a file and copy/paste the contents of the patch into it.
cd coreutils-8.29/
emacs patch.diff

# Apply the patch. Note the use of patch option -p1 strips the smallest prefix
# containing 1 leading slash from each file name in the patch file. For example,
# instead of the entire file name a/src/ls.c being used, src/ls.c is used
# instead.

# Note there is a problem patching the file NEWS, but the fact that patching

# because the patch of src/ls.c succeeds.

+  'ls -aA' is now equivalent to 'ls -A', since -A now overrides -a.
+  [bug introduced in coreutils-5.3.0]
+
   'mv -n A B' no longer suffers from a race condition that can
   overwrite a simultaneously-created B.  This bug fix requires
   platform support for the renameat2 or renameatx_np syscalls, found

automake-1.15: command not found
WARNING: 'automake-1.15' is missing on your system.
         You should only need it if you modified 'Makefile.am' or
         'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.
         The 'automake' program is part of the GNU Automake package:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>
         It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
         <http://www.perl.org/>
make: *** [Makefile:5997: Makefile.in] Error 127

# Note the message about a problem with automake-1.15 not being installed on
# this system.

# We can fix this by using autoreconf to update the generated configuration
# files. This updates the Makefile to use automake-1.16.
autoreconf

make
# This runs successfully now and produces a lot of output about its activity and
# the commands that it runs.

# Commands that needed to be executed:
# Any commands that result in preprocessing, compiling, assembling, or linking
# the changed file src/ls.c to regenerate the executable file src/ls.
# For example: CC src/ls.o, CCLD src/ls, etc. (CC = gcc, CCLD = $(CC))
# Without getting too deep in the weeds of the complex Makefile and the huge
# amount of output that running make produces, if it's set up
# like the example Makefile presented in class then CC src/ls.o is required to
# regenerate the object code file src/ls.o and CCLD src/ls is required to
# regenerate the executable src/ls (linking the regenerated src/ls.o with object
# code files for any library dependencies).

# Commands that weren't needed:
# All others, because the only file that was changed that also affects the
# behavior of the ls command is src/ls.c (the other two files changed were test
# files).
# For example, there was no need to regenerate executables for commands other
# than ls or to regenerate man pages for any commands.
