Laboratory: Managing a backported change

NOTE: Per the spec, this is a log of what I did in the lab so that I can reproduce the results later and I've briefly noted down what I did and what happened. Trivial commands may or may not be
explained.

1. Get a copy of the Diffutils repository, in Git format, from the file ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils on the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers, or from its main Savannah repository.

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. Get a log of changes to Diffutils’ master branch using the “git log” command, and put it into the file git-log.txt.

cd diffutils/
git log > git-log.txt

3. Generate a list of tags used for Diffutils using the “git tag” command, and put it into the file git-tags.txt

git tag > git-tags.txt

4. Find the commit entitled “maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'”, and generate a patch for that commit, putting it into the file quote-patch.txt.

git log --grep="maint: quote 'like this' or \"like this\", not \`like this'"

Output of previous command:
commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.

git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f --stdout > quote-patch.txt

5. Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils from your repository.

git checkout v3.0

6. Use the patch command to apply quote-patch.txt to version 3.0. In some cases it will not be able to figure out what file to patch; skip past those by typing RETURN. Record any problems you had in applying the patch.

patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

There were some files that the patch command couldn't find (in which case I skipped past by typing RETURN and "y"), and some files where the patch command failed patching some of its hunks. They are listed below:
- HACKING (couldn't find)
- doc/diffutils.texi (couldn't find)
- man/help2man (couldn't find)
- README (failed patching some hunks of the file)
- README-hacking (failed patching some hunks of the file)
- cfg.mk (failed patching some hunks of the file)
- src/diff.c (failed patching some hunks of the file)
- src/diff3.c (failed patching some hunks of the file)

Output of previous command:
can't find file to patch at input line 62
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

8. Learn how to use the Emacs functions vc-diff (C-x v =) and vc-revert (C-x v u). When you're in the *vc-diff* buffer generated by vc-diff, use describe-mode (C-h m) to find out the Emacs functions that you can use there, and in particular learn how to use the diff-apply-hunk (C-c C-a) and diff-goto-source (C-c C-c) functions.

I used the following commands and Emacs keystrokes to learn how to use these new Emacs functions.

emacs NEWS
C-x v =
# Did not run use keystrokes C-x v u for vc-revert yet as that will be done in Step 9.
C-h m
C-x o
# Read the documentation on Diff mode.

I also consulted the online documentation for information about how to use each function:
- vc-diff: Compare the work files in the current VC fileset with the versions you started from.
- vc-revert: Revert the work file(s) in the current VC fileset to the last revision.
- diff-apply-hunk: Apply this hunk to its target file. With a prefix argument of C-u, revert this hunk, i.e. apply the reverse of the hunk, which changes the “new” version into the “old” version. If diff-jump-to-old-file is non-nil, apply the hunk to the “old” version of the file instead.
- diff-goto-source: Go to the source file and line corresponding to this hunk. By default, this jumps to the “new” version of the file, the one shown first on the file header. With a prefix argument, jump to the “old” version instead. If diff-jump-to-old-file is non-nil, this command by default jumps to the “old” file, and the meaning of the prefix argument is reversed. If the prefix argument is a number greater than 8 (e.g., if you type C-u C-u C-c C-c), then this command also sets diff-jump-to-old-file for the next invocation.

9. Use Emacs to revert all the changes to files other than .c files, since you want only changes to .c files. Also, and don't forget this part, undo all the changes to .c files other than changes to character string constants, as the character-string changes are the only changes that you want; this may require editing some files by hand.

10. Use Emacs to examine the files src/*.c.rej carefully, and copy rejected patches into the corresponding .c files as needed.

11. Remove all untracked files that git status warns you about, since you don’t plan on adding any files in your patch.

12. When you’re done with the above, git status should report a half-dozen modified files, and git diff should output a patch that is three or four hundred lines long. Put that patch into a file quote-3.0-patch.txt.

13. Build the resulting modified version of Diffutils, using the commands described in the file README-hacking, skipping the part about CVS; CVS is obsolescent. (If you are building on lnxsrv07 or lnxsrv09 or any other host that is using version 2.16 or later of the GNU C Library, you will need to apply an additional patch after running ./bootstrap and before running ./configure, because glibc 2.16 removed the obsolete and dangerous gets function declared by a Diffutils header.) Verify that Diffutils does the right thing with the “diff . -” scenario, as well as with “diff --help”.

14. Do a sanity test using the modified version of Diffutils that you just built, by using the just-built diff to compare the source code of Diffutils 3.0 to the source code of your modified version. Put the former source code into a directory diffutils-3.0 and the latter source code into a directory diffutils-3.0-patch, and run your implementation of diff with the command “D/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt”, where the D is the directory containing your diff implementation.

15. Use diff to compare the contents of quote-3.0-test.txt and quote-3.0-patch.txt. Are the files identical? If not, are the differences innocuous?
